# 💫 About Me:
👋 Salut! I'm Ruby (Rawabi), a computer science graduate passionate about data analysis and frontend development.
🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into programming, exploring different languages and frameworks to enhance my skills in data analysis and frontend/backend development.
💡 I believe data holds the key to valuable insights and informed decision-making. Statistical analysis, data visualization, and storytelling through data are my areas of interest.
👀 I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects, using data to solve complex problems and make a meaningful impact.
💻 On the frontend side, I enjoy creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. Exploring new technologies to enhance user experiences is something I love.
🚀 I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and grow because the tech industry is ever-evolving, offering endless possibilities to explore.
📚 Apart from coding, you'll find me immersed in books. I'm also learning French, German, and Italian to explore more linguistic possibilities. Staying updated with industry news and technology trends is a priority.
✉️ Feel free to connect with me via Email, GitHub, or LinkedIn. I'm open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions related to data analysis and frontend development.
