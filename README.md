# 💫 About Me:
👋 Salut, I’m Ruby (Rawabi), a fresh computer science graduate with a passion for data analysis and frontend development!

🌱 I’m currently learning some programming, exploring various languages and frameworks to enhance my skills in data analysis and frontend/backend development.

💡 I enjoy working with datasets, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing data.

💻 On the frontend side, I enjoy exploring new technologies to enhance the overall user journey.

🚀 I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and grow, as I believe there's always something new to explore. and I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world projects, and make a meaningful impact.

📚 Outside of coding, you'll find me immersed in books. In addition, I'm learning three interesting languages: French, German, and Italian to explore more linguistic possibilities. I also stay up-to-date with industry news and technology trends. 🌍📚💻

✉️ Feel free to connect with me on Email, GitHub, or LinkedIn. I'm open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions related to data analysis and frontend development.
